Each performance of [[Experiment]] with two possible outcomes is called a *Bernoulli Trial * named after [[James Bernoulli]].

Possible outcomes of a *Bernoulli Trial* are called *success* or *failure*.
If probability of success is $p$ and probability of failure is $q$ then $p+q=1$.

Bernoulli Trials are [[Mutually Independent Events]].
