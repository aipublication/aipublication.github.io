Sometimes notations $\bigvee_{j=1}^n p_j$ or $\bigwedge_{j=1}^n p_j$ are used to show [Conjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-conjunction %}) or [Disjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-disjunction %}) over values $p_1, p_2, \dots p_n$ respectively.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































Using this we can write De Morgan Laws as
$$\neg (\bigvee_{j=1}^n p_j) \equiv \bigwedge_{j=1}^n \neg p_j$$
