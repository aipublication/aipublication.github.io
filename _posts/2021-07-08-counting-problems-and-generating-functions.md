[Generating Functions]({% post_url 2021-07-08-generating-functions %}) could be used to find solution of [Counting]({% post_url 2021-07-04-counting %}) problems like 
$$e_1 + e_2 + \dots + e_n = C$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































where $C$ is some constant and $e_i$ is a non-negative integer subjected to some constraints.
