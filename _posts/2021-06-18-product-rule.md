If a procedure could be broken down into two tasks like $t_1$ and $t_2$ and:




















































































































































































































































































































































































































* there are $n_1$ ways to do $t_1$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































* and $n_2$ ways to do $t_2$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































Then total number of ways to do the procedure is $n_1 n_2$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































[Cardinality]({% post_url 2021-06-08-cardinality %}) of [Cartesian Product]({% post_url 2021-06-05-cartesian-product %}) of [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ is equal to product of cardinality of each set combined, given all sets are disjoint and finite.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$|A_1 \times A_2 \times \dots A_n| = |A_1| \cdot |A_2| \cdot \dots \cdot |A_n|$$
