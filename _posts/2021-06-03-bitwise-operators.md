When we perform [Conjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-conjunction %}), [Disjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-disjunction %}) or [Exclusive OR]({% post_url 2021-06-03-exclusive-or %}) bit-by-bit between two [Bit String]({% post_url 2021-06-03-bit-string %}). Operators will be called [Bitwise AND]({% post_url 2021-06-05-bitwise-and %}), [Bitwise OR]({% post_url 2021-06-05-bitwise-or %}) and <b>Bitwise XOR</b> respectively.
