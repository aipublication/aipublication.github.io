We express relation in the form $a_n = r^n$, where $r$ is a constant.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































It is equation is called *solution* of recurrence relation
$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{n-k} a_{n-k} \to (1)$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































iff
$$r^n = c_1 r^{n-1} + c_2 r^{n-2} + \dots + c_{n-k} r^{n-k} \to (2)$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































After dividing this equation with $r^{n-k}$ and moving all the terms to left side we get
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$r^k - c_1 r^{k-1} - c_2 r^{k-2} - \dots - c_{k-1}r - c_{k}=0 \to (3)$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































$(3)$ is called <b>Characteristic Equation</b> and *solutions* of that equation will be called *characteristic roots*.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































### Theorem
Let $c_1, c_2, \dots c_n$ be real numbers.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































The *characteristic equation* with $k$ distinct roots ($r_1, r_2, \dots ,r_n$) will be
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$r^k - c_1 r^{k-1} - c_2 r^{k-2} - \dots - c_{k-1}r - c_{k}=0$$

$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{n-k} a_{n-k}$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































iff
$$a_n = \alpha_1 r_1^n + \alpha_2 r_2^n + \dots + \alpha_k r_k^n$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































for $n=0, 1, 2 \dots$ and $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots \alpha_k$ are constants.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































### Solution with roots with different multiplicities
If a linear homogeneous recurrence relation has roots 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 9 then it has 3 roots with 2, 5, 9 with multiplicities 3, 2, and 1 respectively.

Suppose <b>Characteristic Equation</b> 
$$r^k - c_1 r^{k-1} - c_2 r^{k-2} - \dots - c_{k-1}r - c_{k}=0$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































has $t$ different roots $r_1, r_2 \dots r_t$ with multiplicities $m_1, m_2 \dots m_t$ respectively.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Such that, $m_i \ge 1$ for $i=1, 2, \dots , t$ and $m_1 + m_2 + \dots m_t = k$.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































[Sequence]({% post_url 2021-07-08-sequence %}) ${a_n}$ is solution of [Recurrence Relation]({% post_url 2021-07-11-recurrence-relation %})
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{n-k} a_{n-k}$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































iff
$$a_n = P_1(n) r_1^n + P_2(n) r_2^n + \dots + P_k(n) r_t^n$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Here, $P_t(n)$ is a polynomial of degree $m-1$ expressed as
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a_n = (\alpha_{1,0} +  \alpha_{1,1}n + \dots + \alpha_{1, m_1-1}n^{m_1-1}) r_1^n + (\alpha_{2,0} +  \alpha_{2,1}n + \dots + \alpha_{2, m_2-1}n^{m_2-1}) r_2^n + \dots + (\alpha_{t,0} +  \alpha_{t,1}n + \dots + \alpha_{1, m_t-1}n^{m_t-1}) r_t^n$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































for $n=0, 1, 2 \dots$ and $\alpha_{i, j}$ are constants such that $1 \le i \le t$ and $0 \le j \le m_i -1$.
