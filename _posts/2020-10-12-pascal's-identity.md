Named after French Mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]].

Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n \ge k$. Then

































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {n+1} k = \binom n {k-1} + \binom n k$$


































































































































































































































































































































































Pascal's Identity with initial conditions $\binom n 0 = \binom n n = 1$ could be used to find [[Binomial Coefficient]] using [Recursion]({% post_url 2020-09-17-recursion %}) and this is efficient because addition is used instead of multiplication.
