Let *Base* ($b>1$) be an integer. If $n$ is a positive integer it can be expressed as:




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$n = {a_k}{b^k} + {a_{(k-1)}}{b^{(k-1)}} + \dots {a_1}{b} + a_0$$ \[Base $b$ expansion of $n$ \]




















































































































































































































































































































































































































here $k \ge 0$ and $(a_0, a_1, \dots a_k \ge 0) < b$.
