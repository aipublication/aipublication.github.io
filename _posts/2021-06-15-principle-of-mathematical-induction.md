To [Proofs]({% post_url 2021-06-04-proofs %}) that [Propositional Function]({% post_url 2021-06-03-propositional-function %}) $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$ we have to do two steps:

































































































































































































































































































































































**Basis Step**: Verify that $P(1)$ is true.

































































































































































































































































































































































**Induction Step**: Show that $P(k) \to P(k+1)$ is true for all positive integers $k$.

































































































































































































































































































































































Assumption that $P(k)$ is true is called *inductive hypothesis*.


































































































































































































































































































































































This complete technique could be stated as:
$$(P(1) \wedge \forall k(P(k) \to P(k+1))) \to \forall nP(n)$$

































































































































































































































































































































































Here, [Domain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-domain %}) is set of positive integers.
