Invented by Mathematician <b>David Hilbert</b>.

**Grand Hotel** has [Countable]({% post_url 2021-06-08-countable %}) infinitely many rooms and each room is occupied.
When a new guest arrives he/she can't be accommodated because all rooms are filled.

But, if every guest moves to next room then first room becomes empty and new guest could be accommodated there.
