We know that $|P(Z^{+})| = |P(R)| = \iota$. This could be rewritten as $2^{\aleph_0} = \iota$.


































































































































































































































































































































































Cardinality of a [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) is always less than its [Power Set]({% post_url 2021-06-05-power-set %}). $|P(Z^{+})| > |Z^{+}|$. This could be rewritten as $2^{\aleph_0} > \aleph_0$.


































































































































































































































































































































































This leads us to hypothesis that there exists no set $A$ such that:

































































































































































































































































































































































$$|Z^{+}| < |A| < |R|$$

































































































































































































































































































































































$$\aleph_0 < |A| < \iota$$
