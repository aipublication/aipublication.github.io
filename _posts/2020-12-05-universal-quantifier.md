Universal Quantification of [[Propositional Function]] *P(x)* over any particular domain asserts that *P(x)* is true over all values of *x* in that domain.

It is denoted by $\forall xP(x)$.

If [[Domain of Discourse]] is an empty set then $\forall xP(x)$ will always be true.

It is similar to [[Conjunction]] of P(x) over domain [$x_1, x_n$].
$$P(x_1) \wedge P(x_2) \wedge \dots P(x_n)$$
