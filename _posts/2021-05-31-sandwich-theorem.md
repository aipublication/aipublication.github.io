then if
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = L$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































and
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow c} h(x) = L$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































then surely
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow c} g(x) = L$$
