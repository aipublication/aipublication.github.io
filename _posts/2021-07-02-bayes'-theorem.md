Suppose $E$ and $F$ are [Event]({% post_url 2021-06-20-event %})s from [Sample Space]({% post_url 2021-06-20-sample-space %}) $S$ 
































































































































































































































































































































































































such that $p(E) \neq 0$ and $p(F) \neq 0$
































































































































































































































































































































































































then
$$p(F | E) = {p(E|F)p(F) \over p(E|F)p(F) + p(E|\bar{F})p(\bar{F})}$$
