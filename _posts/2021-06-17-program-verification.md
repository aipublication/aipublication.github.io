A program is said to be *correct* if it generates correct output for every possible input.

It consists of two parts:
* program generates correct output when it terminates. This is called *partial correctness*.
* program always terminates.

[Proposition]({% post_url 2021-06-03-proposition %}) $p\{S\}q$ is used to denote partial correctness of program (or program segment) $S$ with respect to [Initial Assertion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-initial-assertion %}) $p$ and [Final Assertion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-final-assertion %}) $q$. This notation is called *Hoare Triple* named after <b>Tony Hoare</b>.
