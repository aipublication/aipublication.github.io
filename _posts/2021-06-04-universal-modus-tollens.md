It is a combination of [Modus Tollens]({% post_url 2021-06-04-modus-tollens %}) and [Universal Instantiation]({% post_url 2021-06-04-universal-instantiation %}).
If $\forall x(P(x) \to Q(x))$ is true
































































































































































































































































































































































































and if $Q(a)$ is false for a particular element $a$ in domain.
































































































































































































































































































































































































Then $P(a)$ must also be false for that same element.

































































































































































































































































































































































































$\forall x(P(x) \to Q(x))$
































































































































































































































































































































































































$\neg Q(a)\ for\ a\ particular\ element\ in\ domain$
































































































































































































































































































































































































$\therefore \neg P(a)$
