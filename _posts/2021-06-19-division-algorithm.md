Let $a$ be an integer and $d$ be a positive integer then there exists two unique integers $q$ and $r$ ($0 \le r \le d$) such that $a= qd+r$.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































$a$ is called *dividend*
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$d$ is called *divisor*
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$q$ is called *quotient*
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$r$ is called *remainder*
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$q = a/d$ and $r= a\%d$
