Suppose the [Keys]({% post_url 2021-06-20-keys %}) are $k_1, k_2, \dots k_n$.

































































































































































































































































































































































Probability of having a different key after first one is added is $(m-1)/m$.

































































































































































































































































































































































Probability of having a different key after first and second one are added is $(m-2)/m$ and so on.


































































































































































































































































































































































Probability that all $n$ keys are mapped to different locations is

































































































































































































































































































































































$$p_n = {m-1 \over m} \cdot {m-2 \over m} \cdot \dots {m-(n+1) \over m}$$


































































































































































































































































































































































Probability of having at least one [Collision]({% post_url 2021-06-20-collision %}) is
$1 - p_n = 1 - {m-1 \over m} \cdot {m-2 \over m} \cdot \dots {m-(n+1) \over m}$.


































































































































































































































































































































































To find the smallest value of $n$ for given value of $m$ we use relation $n=1.777 \sqrt{m}$.
