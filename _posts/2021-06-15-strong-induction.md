The basis step of *Strong Induction* is same as [Principle of Mathematical Induction]({% post_url 2021-06-15-principle-of-mathematical-induction %}) but for *inductive hypothesis* we assume that $P(j)$ is true for all $j = 1, 2, \dots k$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































Induction Step: $[P(1) \wedge P(2) \wedge \dots P(k)] \to P(k+1)$ where $P(n)$ is a [Propositional Function]({% post_url 2021-06-03-propositional-function %}).





















































































































































































































































































































































































































It is also known as *Second Principle of Mathematical Induction* or *Complete Induction*.
