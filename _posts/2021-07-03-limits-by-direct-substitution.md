We can find limits by directly substituting value of $x$ in $f(x)$ iff the function is continuous.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































$f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ iff $\lim_{x \rightarrow a}f(x) = f(a)$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































### Limits of Absolute Functions
Functions having absolute operator could be broken down into piecewise functions like
$$f(x) = {|x-3| \over x-3}$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































could be re-written as
$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      1 & x > 0 \\
      -1 & x < 0
 \end{cases}
$$

### Limits of Trigonometric Functions
$sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$ are continuous everywhere so





















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\lim_{x \rightarrow a} sin(x) = sin(a)$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\lim_{x \rightarrow a} cos(x) = cos(a)$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































Limits for any input into $sin(x)$ or $cos(x)$ could be obtained by direct substitution.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































But other trigonometric functions aren't continuous everywhere so limits for them cannot be calculated by direct substitution all the time.
