These methods are used to create [Nonconstructive Proofs]({% post_url 2020-04-19-nonconstructive-proofs %}) [Existence Proofs]({% post_url 2020-04-18-existence-proofs %}).

If an element is selected at random from $S$ and probability of that element having some property is less than 1 then there exists an element in $S$ that has the property.

This method is used to find lower bound of [Ramsey Number]({% post_url 2020-12-13-ramsey-number %})s.
If $k$ is an integer such that $k \ge 2$ then $R(k, k) \ge 2^{k \over 2}$.
