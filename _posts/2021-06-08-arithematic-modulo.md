To define arithmetic operation (like addition, multiplication) on set $Z_m$ (set of non-negative integers less than $m$):
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a +_m B = (a+b)mod\ m$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a \cdot_m B = (a \cdot b)mod\ m$$
