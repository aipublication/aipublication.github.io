[Contrapositive]({% post_url 2021-06-03-contrapositive %}) of [Conditional Statement]({% post_url 2021-06-03-conditional-statement %}) $p \to q$ will be [Equivalent]({% post_url 2021-06-03-equivalent %}) to original statement.

* We assume the original statement is false, this is our new statement.
* Then we reach [Negation]({% post_url 2021-06-03-negation %}) of <b>Conclusion</b> (in new statement).
* This proves that <b>Hypothesis</b> was also false (in new statement.
* Thus, original statement was true.
