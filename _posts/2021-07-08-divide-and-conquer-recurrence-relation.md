A problem of size $n$ is divided into $a$ sub-problems where size of each sub-problem is $n/b$ and $g(n)$ extra operations are required to aggregate the sub-solutions. Then [Recurrence Relation]({% post_url 2021-07-11-recurrence-relation %}) of an algorithm that solves the problem using *divide-and-conquer* paradigm will be
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$f(n) = a f(n/b) + g(n)$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































Let $n = b^k$ where $k$ is a positive integer then
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$f(n) = af(n/b) + g(n)$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$f(n) = a^2f(n/b^2) + ag(n/b) + g(n)$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$f(n) = a^3f(n/b^3) + a^2g(n/b^2) + ag(n/b) + g(n)$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\vdots$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$f(n) = a^kf(n/b^k) + \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} a^j g(n/b^j)$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































because $n = b^k$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$f(n) = a^kf(1) + \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} a^j g(n/b^j)$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































### Theorem
If $f$ is an [Increasing Functions]({% post_url 2021-06-07-increasing-functions %}) that satisfies [Recurrence Relation]({% post_url 2021-07-11-recurrence-relation %})
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$f(n) = af(n/b) + c$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































whenever 
* $n$ is divisible by $b$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































* $a \ge 1$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































* $b>1$ 
























































































































































































































































































































































































































* $c$ is positive real number
























































































































































































































































































































































































































then

$$f(n) = \begin{cases} O(n^{log_b a}) & if\ a >1\\ O(log n) & if\ a =1 \end{cases}$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































If $n=b^k$, $a \neq 1$ and $k>0$ then
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$f(n) = C_1 n^{log_b a} + C_2$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































where
$$C_1 = f(1) + {c \over (a-1)}$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































and 
$$C_2 = {-c \over (a-1)}$$
