### Basic Idea
You can get $f(x)$ as close to $L$ "as you want" by getting $x$ sufficiently close to $c$.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































Example: You can get in the range of $f(x)$ in $(L-0.5, L+0.5)$ if $x$ is within range $(c-0.25, c+0.25)$.

### Formal Definition
Given $\epsilon$ > 0
























































































































































































































































































































































































































We can find $\delta$ > 0
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Such that if $|x - c|$ < $\delta$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Then $|y - L|$ < $\epsilon$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































We can call $\delta$ as a function of $\epsilon$.
