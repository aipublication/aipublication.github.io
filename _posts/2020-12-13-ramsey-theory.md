By symmetry it is shown that [Ramsey Number]({% post_url 2020-12-12-ramsey-number %})s $R(m, n)  = R(n, m)$.


































































































































































































































































































































































Also, $R(2, n)=n\ for\ every\ postive\ integer\ n \ge 2$ .
