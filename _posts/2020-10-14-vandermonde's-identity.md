Named after [[Alexandre-Th√©ophile Vandermonde]].

Let $m$, $n$ and $r$ be non negative integers with $r<m$ and $r<n$ then

































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {m+n} r = \sum_{k=0}^r \binom m {r-k} \binom n k$$


































































































































































































































































































































































Number of ways $r$ elements could be picked from a [Set Union]({% post_url 2020-05-19-set-union %}) of $m$ and $n$ could be expressed as product of 

































































































































































































































































































































































* number of ways $k$ elements can be picked from $n$ 

































































































































































































































































































































































* number of ways $r-k$ elements can be picked from $m$


































































































































































































































































































































































### Corollary
If $n$ is a non-negative integer then 

































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {2n} n = \sum_{k=0}^n {\binom n k}^2$$


































































































































































































































































































































































### Theorem
If $n$ and $r$ are non-negative integers and $r \le n$ then

































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {n+1} {r+1} = \sum_{j=r}^n \binom j r$$
