Distribution of [Random Variable]({% post_url 2021-06-20-random-variable %}) $X$ over [Sample Space]({% post_url 2021-06-20-sample-space %}) $S$ is the set of pairs $(r, p(X=r))$ .

































































































































































































































































































































































$\forall r \in S$ and $p(X=r)$ is probability that $X$ takes value $r$.
