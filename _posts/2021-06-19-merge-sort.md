This algorithm is used to arrange an unordered list into increasing or decreasing order.

```
mergesort(arr):
	if n>1:
		m = floor(n/2)
		arr1 = arr[:m+1]
		arr2 = arr[m+1:]
		arr = merge(mergesort(arr1), mergesort(arr2))

merge(arr1, arr2):
	arr = []
	while(len(arr1)!=0 and len(arr2)!=0):
		for a in arr1 and b in arr2:
			if a<b:
				arr.append(a)
				arr1.remove(a)
			else if b<a:
				arr.append(b)
				arr2.remove(b)
	else:
		if arr1 is empty:
			arr.append(arr1)
		else if arr2 is empty:
			arr.append(arr2)
	return arr
```

### Lemma
Two sorted lists with $m$ and $n$ elements could be merged into a single list in not more than $m+n-1$ comparisons.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































### Theorem
Number of comparisons needed to merge sort a list with $n$ elements is $O(n\ log(n))$
