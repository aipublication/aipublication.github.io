[Disjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-disjunction %}) or [Negation]({% post_url 2021-06-03-negation %}) of [Proposition]({% post_url 2021-06-03-proposition %}) variables.

Example:
$$p \vee (q \wedge r) \equiv (p \vee q) \wedge (p \vee r)$$

































































































































































































































































































































































Both $(p \vee q)$ and $(p \vee r)$ are Clauses.

































































































































































































































































































































































So $p \vee (q \wedge r)$ could be expressed as two clauses.
