For two [[Proposition]] *p* and *q*, [[Compound Propositions]] $p \leftrightarrow q$ is true when both both *p* and *q* have same [[Truth Value]] false otherwise.

It is pronounced as *p if and only if q*.

It could also be written as $(p \to q) \wedge (q \to p)$. Where $(q \to p)$ is [[Inverse]] of original [[Proposition]].

Biconditional are also known as *bi-implication*.
