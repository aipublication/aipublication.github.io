A *linear homogeneous recurrence relation* of degree $k$ with constant coefficients has form





















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{n-k} a_{n-k}$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































Here, $c_1, c_2, \dots c_n$ are constant terms and $c_k \neq 0$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































These [Relation]({% post_url 2021-06-05-relation %})s represent terms as a <b>Linear Combination</b> of previous terms.
It is called *linear* because terms in sum on right are multiplied with a [Function]({% post_url 2021-06-07-function %}) of $n$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































Its *homogeneous* because all the terms are multiple of $a_j$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































*Degree* of this relation is the number of previous terms used to express the relation.
