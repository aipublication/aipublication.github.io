Let 
* $a_j$ where $j=1, 2, \dots n$ set of possible inputs
































































































































































































































































































































































































* $X$ be a random variable that assigns $a_j$ number of operations used by algorithm on $a_j$ inputs
































































































































































































































































































































































































* $p(a_j)$ be the probability of each input

































































































































































































































































































































































































Then expected value or average-case computational complexity of algorithm is calculated as
$$E(X) = \sum_{j=1}^n p(a_j)X(a_j)$$
