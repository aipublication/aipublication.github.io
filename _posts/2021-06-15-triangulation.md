Operation of dividing a [Polygon]({% post_url 2021-06-15-polygon %}) into triangles by adding non-intersecting [Diagonal]({% post_url 2021-06-15-diagonal %}).

### Theorem
A [Simple Polygon]({% post_url 2021-06-15-simple-polygon %}) with n [Sides]({% post_url 2021-06-15-sides %}) can be triangulated into $n-2$ triangles. Given $n \ge 3$.


































































































































































































































































































































































### Lemma
Every [Simple Polygon]({% post_url 2021-06-15-simple-polygon %}) with at-least 3 sides has an interior [Diagonal]({% post_url 2021-06-15-diagonal %}).
