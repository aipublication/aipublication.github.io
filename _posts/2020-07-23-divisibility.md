If $a$ and $b$ are integers then we say *$a$ divides $b$* if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b=ac$ and $b \over a$ is an integer.


































































































































































































































































































































































$a$ will be called *factor* of $b$.

































































































































































































































































































































































$b$ will be called *multiple* of $a$.


































































































































































































































































































































































$a$ divides $b$ is represented as $a | b$.
