How many people are needed in one room such that probability of at least two of them having birthday at same day is greater than 1/2?

Assumptions:
1.  Birthdays of people in room are [Mutually Independent Events]({% post_url 2021-06-20-mutually-independent-events %})
2. All birthdays are equally likely
3. There are 366 days in a year

Solution:
Let $p(n)$ be the probability that every one in room has different birthdays.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Then $1 - p(n)$ is the probability that at least two person have same birthday.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































According to assumption 2 as people enter in room the probability of having different (than the people already present in room) birthday has progression like ${365 \over 366}, {364 \over 366}, {363 \over 366}, \dots {(367-n) \over 366}$ where $n$ is the number of people in room.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































So, we have to find the value of $n$ such that $$1 - p(n) = 1 - {365 \over 366} {364 \over 366} {363 \over 366} \dots {(367-n) \over 366} \ge 0.5$$ Therefore $n=23$ for which $1 - p(n) \approx 0.506$.
