We want to prove that [Conditional Statement]({% post_url 2020-01-15-conditional-statement %}) $p \to q$ is true.

































































































































































































































































































































































We assume its [Contradiction]({% post_url 2020-02-02-contradiction %}) $\neg p \to q$ to be true.

































































































































































































































































































































































We conclude that $q$ is false so $\neg p$ should've been false if contradiction is true. Hence, $p$ is true.
