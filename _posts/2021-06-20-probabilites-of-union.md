Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be two [Event]({% post_url 2021-06-20-event %}) on [Sample Space]({% post_url 2021-06-20-sample-space %}) $S$ then [Set Union]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-union %}) of these two events will be

































































































































































































































































































































































$$P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1 \cap E_2)$$


































































































































































































































































































































































This is similar to [Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion]({% post_url 2021-06-05-principle-of-inclusion-exclusion %}).
