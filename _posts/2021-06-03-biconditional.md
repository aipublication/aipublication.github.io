For two [Proposition]({% post_url 2021-06-03-proposition %}) *p* and *q*, [Compound Propositions]({% post_url 2021-06-03-compound-propositions %}) $p \leftrightarrow q$ is true when both both *p* and *q* have same [Truth Value]({% post_url 2021-06-03-truth-value %}) false otherwise.

































































































































































































































































































































































































It is pronounced as *p if and only if q*.

It could also be written as $(p \to q) \wedge (q \to p)$. Where $(q \to p)$ is [Inverse]({% post_url 2021-06-03-inverse %}) of original [Proposition]({% post_url 2021-06-03-proposition %}).
