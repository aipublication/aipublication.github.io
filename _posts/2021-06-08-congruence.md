If $a$ and $b$ are two integers and $m$ is a positive integer. Then we say *$a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$* if $m$ *divides* $a-b$. Notation used for *congruence* will be $a \equiv b (mod\ m)$ and $m$ will be called *modulus*.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































Congruence $a \equiv b (mod\ m)$ is possible if and only if $a\%m = b\%m$ and $a = b+km$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































Concept of congruence was developed by <b>Karl Friedrich Gauss</b>.

Assume $a \equiv b (mod\ m)$ and $c \equiv d (mod\ m)$ then:




















































































































































































































































































































































































































1. $a+c \equiv b+d (mod\ m)$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































2. $ac \equiv bd (mod\ m)$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































Let $a$ and $b$ be integers and $m$ be a positive integer then




















































































































































































































































































































































































































1. $$(a+b)\ mod\ m = ((a\ mod\ m)+(b\ mod\ m))\ mod\ m$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































2. $$(ab)\ mod\ m = ((a\ mod\ m)(b\ mod\ m))\ mod\ m$$
