[Cardinality]({% post_url 2020-07-09-cardinality %}) of union of two sets will be sum of cardinality of both sets less the cardinality of their [Set Intersection]({% post_url 2020-05-21-set-intersection %}).

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

Generalized form of this is called *Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion*.
