Named after French Mathematician <b>Étienne Bézout</b>.
[Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)]({% post_url 2021-06-14-greatest-common-divisor-(gcd) %}) of two integers $a$ and $b$ could be expressed as 

































































































































































































































































































































































$$sa + tb$$

































































































































































































































































































































































where $s$ and $t$ are integers. This form is a <b>Linear Combination</b>.


































































































































































































































































































































































$s$ and $t$ will be called *Bézout coefficients* of $a$ and $b$.

































































































































































































































































































































































Equation $gcd(a, b) = sa + bt$ is called *Bézout Identity*.


































































































































































































































































































































































### Lemma 1
If $a$, $b$ and $c$ are positive integers such that $gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $a | bc$. Then $a | c$


































































































































































































































































































































































### Lemma 2
If $p$ is a [Primes]({% post_url 2021-06-14-primes %}) and $p | a_1, a_2, \dots a_n$ then $p | a_i$ for some integer $i$ where $a_i$ is an integer.


































































































































































































































































































































































### Theorem
Let $m$ be a positive integer and let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be integers. Such that $ac$ and $bc$ have [Congruence]({% post_url 2021-06-08-congruence %}).

































































































































































































































































































































































If $ac \equiv bc\ (mod\ m)$ and $gcd(c, m) = 1$ then $a \equiv b\ (mod\ m)$.
