Difference of set $A$ from set $B$ (denoted as $A - B$) will be the elements of $A$ without elements common with $B$ ([Set Intersection]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-intersection %}) of $A$ and $B$).


































































































































































































































































































































































$$A-B = A -(A \cap B)$$


































































































































































































































































































































































It could also be called *complement of B with respect to A*.

$$A-B = \{x | (x \in A) \wedge (x \notin B)\}$$
