$$((p \vee q) \wedge (\neg p \vee r)) \to (q \vee r)$$


































































































































































































































































































































































Final [Disjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-disjunction %}) $(q \vee r)$ is called *Resolvent*.


































































































































































































































































































































































Resolution plays an important role in programming language such as <b>Prolog</b>.

It could be used to create <b>Automated Theorem Proving Systems</b>.
For that [Premises]({% post_url 2021-06-04-premises %}) have to be expressed as [Clauses]({% post_url 2021-06-04-clauses %}).
