If a task could be done in either $n_1$ or $n_2$ ways and $n_1 \cap n_2 = \varnothing$ then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to do the task.

































































































































































































































































































































































































[Cardinality]({% post_url 2021-06-08-cardinality %}) of [Set Union]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-union %}) of [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ is equal to sum of cardinality of each set combined, given all sets are disjoint and finite.
