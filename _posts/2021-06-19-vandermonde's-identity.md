Named after <b>Alexandre-Th√©ophile Vandermonde</b>.

Let $m$, $n$ and $r$ be non negative integers with $r<m$ and $r<n$ then
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {m+n} r = \sum_{k=0}^r \binom m {r-k} \binom n k$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































Number of ways $r$ elements could be picked from a [Set Union]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-union %}) of $m$ and $n$ could be expressed as product of 
























































































































































































































































































































































































































* number of ways $k$ elements can be picked from $n$ 
























































































































































































































































































































































































































* number of ways $r-k$ elements can be picked from $m$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































### Corollary
If $n$ is a non-negative integer then 
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {2n} n = \sum_{k=0}^n {\binom n k}^2$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































### Theorem
If $n$ and $r$ are non-negative integers and $r \le n$ then
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {n+1} {r+1} = \sum_{j=r}^n \binom j r$$
