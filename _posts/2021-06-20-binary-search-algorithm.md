To find an element $x$ in an array we first compare $x$ with element at middle index ($\lfloor {n+1 \over 2} \rfloor$). If element is not found at middle index then search is proceeded to left subarray (index 0 to middle index - 1) and right subarray (middle index + 1 to index n).

























































































































































































































































































































































































































```
binary_search(i, j, x):
	if(1 <= i <= j <= n):
		m = floor(n+1/2)
		if(a[m]==x):
			return m
		else if(x<a[m] and i<m):
			return binary_search(i, m-1, x)
		else if(x>a[m] and j>m):
			return binary_search(m+1, j, x)
		else:
			return 0
```
