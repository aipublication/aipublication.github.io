Given $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with $a \ge b$. Then number of divisions done by [Euclidean Algorithm]({% post_url 2020-11-07-euclidean-algorithm %}) to find [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)]({% post_url 2020-08-17-greatest-common-divisor-(gcd) %}) of $a$ and $b$ is $5\ \times$ the number of decimal digits in $b$.
