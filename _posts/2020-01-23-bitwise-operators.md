When we perform [Conjunction]({% post_url 2020-01-07-conjunction %}), [Disjunction]({% post_url 2020-01-08-disjunction %}) or [Exclusive OR]({% post_url 2020-01-10-exclusive-or %}) bit-by-bit between two [Bit String]({% post_url 2020-01-21-bit-string %}). Operators will be called [Bitwise AND]({% post_url 2020-05-25-bitwise-and %}), [Bitwise OR]({% post_url 2020-05-24-bitwise-or %}) and [[Bitwise XOR]] respectively.
