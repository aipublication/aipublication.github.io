$$((p \vee q) \wedge (\neg p \vee r)) \to (q \vee r)$$


































































































































































































































































































































































Final [Disjunction]({% post_url 2020-01-08-disjunction %}) $(q \vee r)$ is called *Resolvent*.


































































































































































































































































































































































Resolution plays an important role in programming language such as [[Prolog]].

It could be used to create [[Automated Theorem Proving Systems]].
For that [Premises]({% post_url 2020-03-06-premises %}) have to be expressed as [Clauses]({% post_url 2020-03-18-clauses %}).
