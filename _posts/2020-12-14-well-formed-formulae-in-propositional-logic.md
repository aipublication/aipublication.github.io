We can define the set of *well formed formulae* in [[Propositional Logic]] involving [[Propositional Variables]], [[Logical Operators]], **T** and **F**.

**Basis Step**: **T**, **F** and $s$ where $s$ is a [[Propositional Variables]] are well-formed formulae
**Recursive Step**: If $E$ and $F$ are well-formed formulae then $\neg (E)$, $(E \wedge F)$, $(E \vee F)$, $(E \to F)$ and $(E \leftrightarrow F)$ are also well-formed formulae.
