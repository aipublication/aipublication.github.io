[[Compound Propositions]] that are always equal for all [[Truth Value]]. It is denoted as $p \equiv q$.

If *p* and *q* are logically equivalent then $p \leftrightarrow q$ is a [[Tautology]].

Using this equivalence relation and [[Truth Table]] we can verify [[Laws defined over compound propositions]]
