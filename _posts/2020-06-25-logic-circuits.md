[[Claude Shannon]] first observed that [[Propositional Logic]] could be used to create logic circuits in hardware.

A logic or Digital Circuit receives input bits ($p_1, p_2, \dots p_n$) as 0 (off) or 1 (on) and produces output bits ($s_1, s_2, \dots s_n$) after performing some [[Logical Operators]].

Gates are used as [[Bitwise Operators]]:
- [[NOT Gate]]
- [[OR Gate]]
- [[AND Gate]]
