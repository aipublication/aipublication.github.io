$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{ \infty } a_k x^k$ and $g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{ \infty } b_k x^k$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































Then
$$f(x) + g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{ \infty } (a_k + b_k) x^k$$
