Named after Russian mathematician <b>Pafnuty Lvovish Chebyshev</b>.

It provided an upper bound on the probability of a [Random Variable]({% post_url 2021-07-08-random-variable %}) taking a value different from its [Expected Value]({% post_url 2021-07-02-expected-value %}) by a given amount.

If $X$ is a random variable over sample space $S$ and $r$ is a real number then
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$p(|X(s) - E(X)| \ge r) \le V(X) / r^2$$
