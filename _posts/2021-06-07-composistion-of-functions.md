Let $g: A \rightarrow B$ and $f: B \rightarrow C$. Then composition (denoted as $f \circ g$) of both functions for all $a \in A$ is
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$(f \circ g)(a)= f(g(a))$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































[Range]({% post_url 2021-06-07-range %}) of function $g$ has to be a [Subsets]({% post_url 2021-06-05-subsets %}) of [Domain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-domain %}) of function $f$.
