Statements that are neither true nor false until the value of a particular [Propositional Variables]({% post_url 2021-06-03-propositional-variables %}) is specified.

Using this we can represent [Proposition]({% post_url 2021-06-03-proposition %}) as a function. Like $P(x)$, where value of $P(x)$ will be true or false depending on the value of $x$. This could be generalized using [Propositional Function]({% post_url 2021-06-03-propositional-function %}) and [n-ary Predicate]({% post_url 2021-06-03-n-ary-predicate %}).
