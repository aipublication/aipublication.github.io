Suppose a program $S$ is divided in into two consecutive segments $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that $p\{S_1\}q$ and $q\{S_2\}r$.


































































































































































































































































































































































Then to show $p\{S\}r$ is correct we have to show $p\{S_1\}q$ and $q\{S_2\}r$ are also correct.


































































































































































































































































































































































$$

































































































































































































































































































































































\begin{align}
	p\{S_1\}q \\
	q\{S_2\}r \\
	\hline \\
	\therefore p\{S_1 ; S_2\}r
\end{align}
