Let $a$ be an integer and $d$ be a positive integer then there exists two unique integers $q$ and $r$ ($0 \le r \le d$) such that $a= qd+r$.


































































































































































































































































































































































$a$ is called *dividend*

































































































































































































































































































































































$d$ is called *divisor*

































































































































































































































































































































































$q$ is called *quotient*

































































































































































































































































































































































$r$ is called *remainder*

































































































































































































































































































































































$q = a/d$ and $r= a\%d$
