Sum of terms of [Geometric Progression (GP)]({% post_url 2021-06-07-geometric-progression-(gp) %}).

Suppose in a GP $a$ and $r$ are real numbers and $r \neq 0$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\sum_{j=0}^{n} ar^{j} = 
























































































































































































































































































































































































































\begin{cases}

      (n+1)a & if\ r = 1
