Divide-and-Conquer is a paradigm of algorithms which divide a problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them individually. Then those sub-solutions are aggregated to calculate original solution.

Example: [Merge Sort]({% post_url 2021-06-19-merge-sort %}), [Binary Search Algorithm]({% post_url 2021-06-20-binary-search-algorithm %}).
