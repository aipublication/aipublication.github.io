Let $f$ be an [Increasing Functions]({% post_url 2021-06-07-increasing-functions %}) that satisfies [Recurrence Relation]({% post_url 2021-07-08-recurrence-relation %})




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$f(n) = af(n/b) + cn^d$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































where 
* $n = b^k$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































* $k>0$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































* $b>1$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































* $c$ and $d$ are real numbers and $c>0$ and $d \ge 0$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































then 
$$f(n) = \begin{cases} O(n^{d}) & if\ a<b^d \\ O(n^d log n) & if\ a = b^d \\ O(n^{log_b a}) & if\ a \ge b^d \end{cases}$$
