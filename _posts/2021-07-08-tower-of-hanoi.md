Invented by French Mathematician <b>Édouard Lucas</b>.

### Problem Statement
It consists of three pegs and disks (of different sizes) mounted on a board.
Initially all disks are at first peg in increasing order of sizes.

### Objective
To move all three disks to second peg in increasing order of sizes.

### Rules
* Only one disk could be moved at a time
* Disk could not be placed on top of a disk smaller in size

### Solution
If $H_n$ is the number of moves it takes to solve *Tower of Hanoi Problem*.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































So in $H_{n-1}$ moves, $(n-1)$ disks could be moved to third peg.

Then it will take one more move to put largest disk on second peg.

Finally, it will take $H_{n-1}$ moves again to move all $(n-1)$ disks from third peg to second peg.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$H_n = 2H_{n-1} + 1$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































This is a [Recurrence Relation]({% post_url 2021-07-08-recurrence-relation %}).

[Initial Condition]({% post_url 2021-07-08-initial-condition %}) of this relation will be $H_1 = 1$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































If we solve this relation iteratively (expressing terms using previous terms and using initial condition at last step) then we get
$$H_n = 2^n - 1$$
