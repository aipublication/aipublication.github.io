[Compound Propositions]({% post_url 2021-06-03-compound-propositions %}) that are always equal for all [Truth Value]({% post_url 2021-06-03-truth-value %}). It is denoted as $p \equiv q$.

































































































































































































































































































































































































If *p* and *q* are logically equivalent then $p \leftrightarrow q$ is a [Tautology]({% post_url 2021-06-03-tautology %}).

































































































































































































































































































































































































Using this equivalence relation and [Truth Table]({% post_url 2021-06-03-truth-table %}) we can verify [Laws defined over compound propositions]({% post_url 2021-06-03-laws-defined-over-compound-propositions %})
