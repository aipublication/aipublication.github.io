Here, domain over which quantifier is true is specified in the end.

Restricting a [Universal Quantifier]({% post_url 2020-02-22-universal-quantifier %}) by applying a condition to its inputs is similar to applying [Universal Quantifier]({% post_url 2020-02-22-universal-quantifier %}) over a [Conditional Statement]({% post_url 2020-01-15-conditional-statement %}).
