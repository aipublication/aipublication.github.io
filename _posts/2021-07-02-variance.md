Variance of [Random Variable]({% post_url 2021-07-08-random-variable %}) $X$ is weighted average of square of [Deviation]({% post_url 2021-07-02-deviation %}). It is defined as




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$V(X) = \sum_{s \in S}(X(s) - E(X))^2 p(s)$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































It could also be calculated as
$$V(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































If $E(X) = \mu$ where $\mu$ is mean then $V(X) = E((X- \mu)^2)$.
