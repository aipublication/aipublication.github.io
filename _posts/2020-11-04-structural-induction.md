Instead of using [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]] for proving [[Theorem]] on recursive [[Sets]] we use **Structural Induction**.

**Basis Step**: For an element to be in set the result of applying the statement should be true.
**Recursive Step**: Result of applying statement on new elements constructed from the elements in the set is also true.
