When either *p* or *q* can be true. But in order to satisfy the [Proposition]({% post_url 2021-06-03-proposition %}) both can't be true at same time.

As a [Logical Operators]({% post_url 2021-06-03-logical-operators %}) it is represented as $\oplus$. [Compound Propositions]({% post_url 2021-06-03-compound-propositions %}) could be written as $p \oplus q$.
