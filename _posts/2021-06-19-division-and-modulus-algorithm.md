For two integers $a$ and $d$.

































































































































































































































































































































































If $a$ is positive we perform $(a-d)$ until $(a-d)<d$. The number of times this operation is performed will be *quotient* and value of $(a-d)$ at last will be *remainder*.


































































































































































































































































































































































<b>Time Complexity</b> of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$.
