If $X_i$ for $i=1, 2, \dots n$ are [Random Variable]({% post_url 2021-06-20-random-variable %}) over sample space $S$ and $a$ and $b$ are real numbers then:
































































































































































































































































































































































































1. $$E(X_1 + X_2 \dots + X_n) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) \dots + E(X_n)$$
































































































































































































































































































































































































2. $$E(aX + b) = a E(X) + b$$
