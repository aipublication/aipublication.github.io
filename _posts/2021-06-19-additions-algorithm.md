To add two integers (in any [Base]({% post_url 2021-06-08-base %}) expansion) we start with rightmost values
$$a_0 + b_0 = c_0 \cdot b + s_0$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































$s_0$ will be the rightmost bit of sum and $c_0$ will be the *carry*. Carry will be added to sum of next values.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a_1 + b_1 + c_0 = c_1 \cdot b + s_1$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































This process will go on till all the values are added.

<b>Time Complexity</b> of addition algorithm is $O(2n)$ (or simply $O(n)$) \[ $n$ times  addition of values + $n$ times addition of carries \].
