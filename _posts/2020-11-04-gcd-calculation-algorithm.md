Calculation of [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)]({% post_url 2020-08-17-greatest-common-divisor-(gcd) %}) of two integers $a$ and $b$ could be reduced to $\gcd(b\ mod\ a, a)$.

































































































































































































































































































































































This is a recursive implementation of [Euclidean Algorithm]({% post_url 2020-11-07-euclidean-algorithm %}).

```
gcd(a, b):
	if(a>0 and b>0 and a<b):
		if (a==0):
			return b
		else:
			return gcd(b mod a, a)
```
