[Cardinality]({% post_url 2021-06-08-cardinality %}) of union of two sets will be sum of cardinality of both sets less the cardinality of their [Set Intersection]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-intersection %}).

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































Generalized form of this is called *Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion*.

Let $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ be finite sets.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Then
$$|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots A_n| = \sum_{1 \le i \le n} |A_i| - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} | A_i \cap A_j| + \sum_{1 \le i < j < k \le n} |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \dots + (-1)^{(n+1)} | A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n |$$
