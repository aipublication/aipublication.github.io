We know that $p \to q$ is true when $p$ is false.

































































































































































































































































































































































So, if we can proof that $p$ is false we have a *Vacuous Proof*.


































































































































































































































































































































































They are used to establish special cases of [Theorem]({% post_url 2020-03-31-theorem %}) that state that a [Conditional Statement]({% post_url 2020-01-15-conditional-statement %}) is true for all positive integers (theorem of kind $\forall nP(n)$)
