### Extended Binomial Coefficient
To solve [Counting]({% post_url 2021-07-04-counting %}) problems we will need [Binomial Theorem]({% post_url 2021-06-19-binomial-theorem %}) with non-positive exponents.

If $u$ is a real number and $k$ is a non-negative integer then extended <b>Binomial Coefficient</b>  $\binom u k$ is defined as 
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom u k = \begin{cases} u(u-1) \dots (u-k+1)/ k! & if\ k>0 \\ 1 & if\ k=0\end{cases}$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































For negative $u$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {-u} r = (-1)^r C(u+r-1, r)$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































See [Combination]({% post_url 2021-06-19-combination %}) to calculate value of $C(u+r-1, r)$.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































### Extended Binomial Theorem
If $x$ and $u$ are real numbers and $|x| < 1$ then
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$(1+x)^u = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom u k x^k$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































This theorem can be proved using <b>Maclaurin Series</b>.
