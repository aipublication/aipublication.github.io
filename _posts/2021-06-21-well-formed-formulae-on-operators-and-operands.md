Similar to [Well-Formed Formulae in Propositional Logic]({% post_url 2021-06-16-well-formed-formulae-in-propositional-logic %}). Well-formed formulae could be defined over set $\{ +, -, *, /, \uparrow \}$ where $\uparrow$ is *Exponential*.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































**Basis Step**:  $x$ is a formulae if $x$ is a numeral or a variable.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































**Recursive Step**: If $F$ and $G$ are well-formed formulae then $(F + G)$, $(F - G)$, $(F*G)$, $(F/G)$ and $(F \uparrow G)$ are also well-formed formulae.
