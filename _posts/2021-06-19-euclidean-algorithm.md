Named after Greek mathematician <b>Euclid</b>.

Let $a, b, q$ and $r$ be integers such that $a = bq + r$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































Then $gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)$ 





















































































































































































































































































































































































































So, if we successively apply [Division Algorithm]({% post_url 2021-06-19-division-algorithm %}). The [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)]({% post_url 2021-06-14-greatest-common-divisor-(gcd) %}) will be the last non-zero remainder.
