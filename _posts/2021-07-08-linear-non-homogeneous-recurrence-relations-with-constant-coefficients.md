A linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficient is of form 
$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{k} a_{n-k} + F(n)$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{k} a_{n-k}$ is called *associated homogeneous recurrence relation* and $F(n)$ is a [Function]({% post_url 2021-06-07-function %}) dependent on just $n$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































### Solution of Linear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence Relation with Constant Coefficients
If [Sequence]({% post_url 2021-07-08-sequence %}) $\{a_n^{(p)}\}$ is *particular solution* of a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{k} a_{n-k} + F(n)$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































then every solution is of form $\{a_n^{(p)} + a_n^{(h)}\}$. 




















































































































































































































































































































































































































Here [Sequence]({% post_url 2021-07-08-sequence %}) $\{ a_n^{(h)} \}$ is *solution* of associated homogeneous recurrence relation




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{k} a_{n-k}$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































### Theorem
Suppose [Sequence]({% post_url 2021-07-08-sequence %}) $\{a_n^{(p)}\}$ is *particular solution* of a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$a_n = c_1 a_{n-1} + c_2 a_{n-2} + \dots + c_{k} a_{n-k} + F(n)$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































and
$$F(n) = (b_t n^t + b_{t-1}n^{t-1} + \dots + b_1 n+b_0)s^n$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































here $b_t, b_{t-1} \dots b_0$ and $s$ are real numbers.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































**Case 1:** When $s$ is not a root of <b>Characteristic Equation</b> of the associated homogeneous recurrence relation.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































Then there is a particular of form
$$(p_t n^t + p_{t-1} n^{t-1} + \dots + p_1 n + p_0)s^n$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































**Case 2:** When $s$ is a root of <b>Characteristic Equation</b> of the associated homogeneous recurrence relation with multiplicity $m$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































Then there is a particular of form
$$n^m(p_t n^t + p_{t-1} n^{t-1} + \dots + p_1 n + p_0)s^n$$
