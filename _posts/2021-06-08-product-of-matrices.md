Let $A$ be a matrix of order $m \times k$ and $B$ be a matrix of order $k \times n$.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Then $A \times B$ will be a matrix of order $m \times n$.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































$A \times B = [c_{ij}]$ such that $c_{ij} = a_{i1}b_{1j} + a_{i2}b_{2j} + \dots a_{ik}b_{kj}$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































Matrix multiplication is not *commutative*. $A \times B \neq B \times A$
