A *Matrix* is a rectangular array of numbers.
A matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns has order $m \times n$.

































































































































































































































































































































































If $m=n$ then it is called a $square matrix$.


































































































































































































































































































































































Two matrices are equal if they have same number of rows and columns and their corresponding entries are equal.
