We assume [Universal Set]({% post_url 2021-06-05-universal-set %}) to be finite (bounded by <b>Memory</b> limits of system).
To store set $A$, we create a [Bit String]({% post_url 2021-06-03-bit-string %}) with 1 corresponding to the elements belonging to $A$ and 0 otherwise.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$A =\ Set\ of\ odd\ numbers$$
























































































































































































































































































































































































































$$Bit\ String\ for\ A=101010101$$

























































































































































































































































































































































































































To find [Set Complement]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-complement %}) of [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) we just apply [Negation]({% post_url 2021-06-03-negation %}) operator on each bit.
To find [Set Union]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-union %}) of [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) we apply [Bitwise OR]({% post_url 2021-06-05-bitwise-or %}).
To find [Set Intersection]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-intersection %}) of [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) we apply [Bitwise AND]({% post_url 2021-06-05-bitwise-and %}).
