Let $T$ be a transformation such that
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$T(x) = x/2\ if\ x\ is\ even$$
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$T(x) = 3x+1\ if\ x\ is\ odd$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































The [Conjecture]({% post_url 2021-06-04-conjecture %}) states that if we repeatedly apply this transformation on any number we will converge on 1.

It has been proved by computer for $x$ over $5.6 \times 10^{13}$.
