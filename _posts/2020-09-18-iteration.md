It is a method to find [Closed Formula]({% post_url 2020-06-25-closed-formula %}) or [Initial Condition]({% post_url 2020-06-24-initial-condition %}) by reapplying [Recurrance Relations]({% post_url 2020-06-26-recurrance-relations %}).

It is also a method of repeatedly applying **Recursive Step** from [Recursion]({% post_url 2020-09-17-recursion %}) on each element starting from **Basis Step**. This is similar to [Strong Induction]({% post_url 2020-08-19-strong-induction %}).
