It is a method to find [Closed Formula]({% post_url 2021-06-07-closed-formula %}) or [Initial Condition]({% post_url 2021-06-07-initial-condition %}) by reapplying [Recurrance Relations]({% post_url 2021-06-07-recurrance-relations %}).

It is also a method of repeatedly applying **Recursive Step** from [Recursion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-recursion %}) on each element starting from **Basis Step**. This is similar to [Strong Induction]({% post_url 2021-06-15-strong-induction %}).
