Let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be two [Real-Valued Functions]({% post_url 2021-06-07-real-valued-functions %}).
































































































































































































































































































































































































Their [Domain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-domain %}) is a set $A$ and their [Codomain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-codomain %}) is set $R$ (set of all real numbers).

































































































































































































































































































































































































Then $f_1 + f_2$ and $f_1 f_2$ are also [Real-Valued Functions]({% post_url 2021-06-07-real-valued-functions %}) defined over same [Domain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-domain %}) and [Codomain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-codomain %}).
