*While loop* has structure like
```
while condition
	S
```
It is executed till condition becomes false.

*Loop Invariant* is an assertion that is true each time program segment $S$ is executed. 

































































































































































































































































































































































If $p$ is loop invariant then $(p \wedge condition)\{S\}p$ is true.


































































































































































































































































































































































$$

































































































































































































































































































































































\begin{align}
	(p \wedge condition)\{S\}p \\
	\hline \\
	\therefore p\{while\ condition\ S\}(\neg condition \wedge p)
\end{align}
$$
