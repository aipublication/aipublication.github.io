A [Random Variable]({% post_url 2021-06-20-random-variable %}) $X$ has a *geometric distribution* with parameter $p$ if $p(X=k)=(1-p)^{k-1}p$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \dots$ where $p$ is a real number with $0< p \le 1$.

































































































































































































































































































































































































The expectation of random variable will be $E(x) = 1/p$.

































































































































































































































































































































































































Random variables with geometric distribution are used in cases such as:
* finding number of tosses after which head or tail occurs for first time
* number of uses after which product fails
