**Basis Step**: A single vertex $r$ is a [Full Binary Tree]({% post_url 2021-06-16-full-binary-tree %}).

































































































































































































































































































































































**Recursive Step**: If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are full binary trees with dijointed roots then there exist a full binary tree with root $r$ and left subtree as $T_1$ and right subtree as $T_2$.
