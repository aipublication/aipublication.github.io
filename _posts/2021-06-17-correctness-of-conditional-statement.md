To prove that a [Conditional Statement]({% post_url 2021-06-03-conditional-statement %}) is true we have to prove:
* if [Initial Assertion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-initial-assertion %}) is true and *condition* is true then [Final Assertion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-final-assertion %}) is true when program terminates.
* if [Initial Assertion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-initial-assertion %}) is true and *condition* is false then [Final Assertion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-final-assertion %}) is true when program terminates because [Final Assertion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-final-assertion %}) checks validity of all outputs.
