Named after French Mathematician <b>Pierre-Simon Laplace</b>.

Assume an event $E$ with $m$ outcomes

































































































































































































































































































































































$$p(E) = \sum_{i=1}^m {1 \over n} = {m \over n}$$

































































































































































































































































































































































because $|E| = m$ and $|S| = n$

































































































































































































































































































































































$$p(E) = {|E| \over |S|} = {m \over n}$$
