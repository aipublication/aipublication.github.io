A [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) of [Rooted Trees]({% post_url 2021-06-16-rooted-trees %}) can be defined recursively.

**Basis Step**: A single vertex $r$ is a rooted tree.

































































































































































































































































































































































**Recursive Step**: Suppose that $T_1, T_2, \dots T_n$ are disjointed rooted trees with roots $r_1, r_2, \dots r_n$ and another vertex $r$ which isn't a vertex of any of the trees.

































































































































































































































































































































































We can connect $r$ with $r_1, r_2, \dots r_n$ and the final <b>Tree</b> formed will be a rooted tree.
