**Basis Step**: An empty [Sets]({% post_url 2020-07-03-sets %}) is an [Extended Binary Trees]({% post_url 2020-09-05-extended-binary-trees %})
**Recursive Step**: If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are extended binary trees with dijointed roots then there exist an extended binary tree with root $r$ and left subtree as $T_1$ and right subtree as $T_2$ where these trees are nonempty.
