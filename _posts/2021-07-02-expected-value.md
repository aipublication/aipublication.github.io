Expected value is probability weighted average of values of [Random Variable]({% post_url 2021-06-20-random-variable %}).

*Expected value* or *expectation* or *mean* of a random variable $X$ over sample space $S$ is
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$E(X)= \sum_{s \in S}p(s)X(s)$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































Expectation is defined on an <b>Infinite Series</b> only when the series is <b>Convergent</b>.

Let $X$ be a random variable and $p(X=r)$ be the probability that random variable takes value $r$ such that
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$p(X=r) = \sum_{s \in S, X(s)=r} p(s)$$
































































































































































































































































































































































































then
$$E(X) = \sum_{r \in X(s)} p(X=r)r$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































Expected number of successes when $n$ [Mutually Independent Events]({% post_url 2021-06-20-mutually-independent-events %}) [Bernoulli Trials]({% post_url 2021-06-20-bernoulli-trials %}) are performed is $np$ where $p$ is the probability of success.
