desc: A subsequence of a sequence $a_1, a_2 \dots a_n$ is of form $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2} \dots a_{i_m}$ where $1 \le i_1 \le i_2 \dots \le i_m \le N$.

A *subsequence* of a sequence $a_1, a_2 \dots a_n$ is of form $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2} \dots a_{i_m}$ where $1 \le i_1 \le i_2 \dots \le i_m \le N$. 

































































































































































































































































































































































It is obtained from original sequence by taking some of the elements of it in same order and perhaps not including other terms.

A sequence is *strictly increasing* if every term is larger than its previous term.
A sequence is *strictly decreasing* if every term is smaller than its previous term.

### Theorem
Every sequence of $n^2 + 1$ distinct integers contains a subsequence of length $n+1$ that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
