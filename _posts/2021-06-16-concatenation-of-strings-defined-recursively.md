[Concatenation]({% post_url 2021-06-16-concatenation %}) can be defined recursively.
Let $\Sigma$ be a set of symbols and $\Sigma^*$ be a set of strings formed from $\Sigma$.


































































































































































































































































































































































**Basis Step**: If $w \in \Sigma^*$ then $w \cdot \lambda = w$ where $\lambda$ is <b>Empty String</b>.

































































































































































































































































































































































**Recursive Step**: If $w_1 \in \Sigma^*$ and $w_2 \in \Sigma^*$ and $w_1 \in \Sigma$ then $w_1 \cdot (w_2 x) = (w_1 w_2) \cdot x$
