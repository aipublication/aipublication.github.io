To find an element $x$ in an array this algorithm iterates over the complete list element-by-element.


































































































































































































































































































































































```
search(i, j, x):
	if(1 <= i <= j <= n):
		if(a[i]=x):
			return i
		else if (i=j):
			return 0
		else:
			return search(i+1, j, x)
```
