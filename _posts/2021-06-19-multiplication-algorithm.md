To multiply two integers $a$ and $c$ having base $b$ we do
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$ac = a(c_0 b^0 + c_1 b^1 + \dots c_{(n-1)} b^{(n-1)})$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































<b>Time Complexity</b> of addition for this algorithm is $O(n^2)$ \[ $O(n)$ for shifting products times $O(n)$ for performing additions \].
