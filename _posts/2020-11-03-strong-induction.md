desc: The basis step of *Strong Induction* is same as [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]] but for *inductive hypothesis* we assume that $P(j)$ is true for all $j = 1, 2, \dots k$.

The basis step of *Strong Induction* is same as [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]] but for *inductive hypothesis* we assume that $P(j)$ is true for all $j = 1, 2, \dots k$.

Induction Step: $[P(1) \wedge P(2) \wedge \dots P(k)] \to P(k+1)$ where $P(n)$ is a [[Propositional Function]].

It is also known as *Second Principle of Mathematical Induction* or *Complete Induction*.
