Let $S$ be a set with finite $n$ distinct elements.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Then $S$ is a finite set and $n$ is *cardinality* or size of set.
























































































































































































































































































































































































































Cardinality of set $S$ could also be denoted as $|S|$.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































If there is a [One-to-One Functions]({% post_url 2021-06-07-one-to-one-functions %}) $f:A \to B$ then $|A| \le |B|$.
