If $S$ is a finite nonempty [Sample Space]({% post_url 2021-06-20-sample-space %}) and $E$ is an [Event]({% post_url 2021-06-20-event %}) from that sample space then probability of $E$ is $p(E) = {|E| \over |S|}$.

































































































































































































































































































































































































According to Laplace's Definition probability ranges from 0 to 1.

So $0 \le |E| \le |S|$ because $|S|=1$
































































































































































































































































































































































































and $0 \le p(E) = |E|/|S| \le 1$.
