To prove that a set of positive rational numbers is [Countable]({% post_url 2021-06-08-countable %}), we first arrange the numbers such that numbers with denominator 1 are listed in first row, denominator 2 are listed in second row and so on.

Then we create a [Sequence]({% post_url 2021-07-08-sequence %}) such that first are numbers with $p+q = 1$ then $p+q=2$ and so on. We don't mention a number more than once.

Because all positive rational numbers are listed once we can verify that it is countable.
