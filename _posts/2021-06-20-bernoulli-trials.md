Each performance of [Experiment]({% post_url 2021-06-20-experiment %}) with two possible outcomes is called a *Bernoulli Trial * named after <b>James Bernoulli</b>.

Possible outcomes of a *Bernoulli Trial* are called *success* or *failure*.
If probability of success is $p$ and probability of failure is $q$ then $p+q=1$.
