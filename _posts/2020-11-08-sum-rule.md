If a task could be done in either $n_1$ or $n_2$ ways and $n_1 \cap n_2 = \varnothing$ then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to do the task.

[[Cardinality]] of [[Set Union]] of [[Sets]] $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ is equal to sum of cardinality of each set combined, given all sets are disjoint and finite.
$$|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots A_n| = |A_1| + |A_2| + \dots + |A_n|$$
