It is a square matrix of order $n \times n$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$I = [\delta_{ij}]$ such that $\delta_{ij} = 1$ when $i=j$ and $\delta_{ij} = 0$ when $i \neq j$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$AI_n = I_mA = A$$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$A^0 = I_n$$
