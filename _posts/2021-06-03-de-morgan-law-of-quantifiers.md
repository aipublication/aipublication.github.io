This is true because [Universal Quantifier]({% post_url 2021-06-03-universal-quantifier %}) is similar to [Conjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-conjunction %}) and [Existential Quantifier]({% post_url 2021-06-03-existential-quantifier %}) is similar to [Disjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-disjunction %}).

It could be verified from [Laws defined over compound propositions]({% post_url 2021-06-03-laws-defined-over-compound-propositions %}).
