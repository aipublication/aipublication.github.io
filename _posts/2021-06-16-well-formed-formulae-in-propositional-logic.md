We can define the set of *well formed formulae* in [Propositional Logic]({% post_url 2021-06-04-propositional-logic %}) involving [Propositional Variables]({% post_url 2021-06-03-propositional-variables %}), [Logical Operators]({% post_url 2021-06-03-logical-operators %}), **T** and **F**.

**Basis Step**: **T**, **F** and $s$ where $s$ is a [Propositional Variables]({% post_url 2021-06-03-propositional-variables %}) are well-formed formulae

































































































































































































































































































































































**Recursive Step**: If $E$ and $F$ are well-formed formulae then $\neg (E)$, $(E \wedge F)$, $(E \vee F)$, $(E \to F)$ and $(E \leftrightarrow F)$ are also well-formed formulae.
