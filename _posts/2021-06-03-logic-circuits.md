<b>Claude Shannon</b> first observed that [Propositional Logic]({% post_url 2021-06-04-propositional-logic %}) could be used to create logic circuits in hardware.

A logic or Digital Circuit receives input bits ($p_1, p_2, \dots p_n$) as 0 (off) or 1 (on) and produces output bits ($s_1, s_2, \dots s_n$) after performing some [Logical Operators]({% post_url 2021-06-03-logical-operators %}).

































































































































































































































































































































































































Gates are used as [Bitwise Operators]({% post_url 2021-06-03-bitwise-operators %}):
- [NOT Gate]({% post_url 2021-06-03-not-gate %})
- [OR Gate]({% post_url 2021-06-03-or-gate %})
- [AND Gate]({% post_url 2021-06-03-and-gate %})
