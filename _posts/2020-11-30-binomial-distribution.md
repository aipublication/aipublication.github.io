Probability of $k$ success in $n$ independent Bernoulli Trials is $C(n, k) p^k q^{n-k}$. It is denoted as $b(k; n, p)$.


































































































































































































































































































































































Sum of $k$ successes for different values of $k$ is $$\sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) p^k q^{n-k} = (p+q)^n = 1$$ which is same as [Binomial Theorem]({% post_url 2020-10-13-binomial-theorem %}).
