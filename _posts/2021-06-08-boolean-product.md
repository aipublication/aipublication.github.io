Let $A=[a_{ij}]$ and $B=[b_{ij}]$ be two matrices of order $m \times k$ and $k \times n$ respectively. Then boolean product $A \odot B$ will be $A \odot B =[c_{ij}]$




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$$c_{ij} = (a_{i1} \wedge b_{1j}) \vee (a_{i2} \wedge b_{2j}) \vee \dots (a_{k1} \wedge b_{kj})$$





















































































































































































































































































































































































































This is similar to [Product of Matrices]({% post_url 2021-06-08-product-of-matrices %}) but with *Boolean Operations*.

Matrix $A$ raise to boolean power $r$ is denoted as $A^{[r]}$. Is boolean product of matrix $A$ with itself. Also, $A^{[0]} = I_n$
