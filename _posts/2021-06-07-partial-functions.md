For a partial function $f$ is an assignment of a unique element $a$ (in a subset of [Domain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-domain %}) of $A$ called *domain of definition*) to a unique element $b \in B$.

































































































































































































































































































































































































Elements not present *domain of definition* of $A$ are called *undefined*.

































































































































































































































































































































































































When [Domain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-domain %}) is same as *domain of definition* the function is called *total function*.
