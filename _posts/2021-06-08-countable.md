A [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) that has same cardinality as set of positive integers.
If an infinite set is countable we write its cardinality as $\aleph_0$ (Pronounced as "aleph null").


































































































































































































































































































































































If two sets $A$ and $B$ are countable then $A \cup B$ ([Set Union]({% post_url 2021-06-05-set-union %}) is also countable.
