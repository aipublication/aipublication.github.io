Instead of using [Principle of Mathematical Induction]({% post_url 2020-08-30-principle-of-mathematical-induction %}) for proving [Theorem]({% post_url 2020-03-31-theorem %}) on recursive [Sets]({% post_url 2020-07-03-sets %}) we use **Structural Induction**.

**Basis Step**: For an element to be in set the result of applying the statement should be true.
**Recursive Step**: Result of applying statement on new elements constructed from the elements in the set is also true.
