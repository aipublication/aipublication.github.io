Universal Quantification of [Propositional Function]({% post_url 2021-06-03-propositional-function %}) *P(x)* over any particular domain asserts that *P(x)* is true over all values of *x* in that domain.

It is denoted by $\forall xP(x)$.

































































































































































































































































































































































































If [Domain of Discourse]({% post_url 2021-06-03-domain-of-discourse %}) is an empty set then $\forall xP(x)$ will always be true.

































































































































































































































































































































































































It is similar to [Conjunction]({% post_url 2021-06-03-conjunction %}) of P(x) over domain [$x_1, x_n$].
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$P(x_1) \wedge P(x_2) \wedge \dots P(x_n)$$
