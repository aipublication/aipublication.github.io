Here, domain over which quantifier is true is specified in the end.

Restricting a [Universal Quantifier]({% post_url 2021-06-03-universal-quantifier %}) by applying a condition to its inputs is similar to applying [Universal Quantifier]({% post_url 2021-06-03-universal-quantifier %}) over a [Conditional Statement]({% post_url 2021-06-03-conditional-statement %}).
