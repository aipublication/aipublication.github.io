Proofs are really important in <b>Computer Science</b> they are used to verify if a computer program produces valid output for all sets of inputs.

It is a [Valid]({% post_url 2021-06-04-valid %})[Arguments]({% post_url 2021-06-04-arguments %}) that establishes the truth of a [Theorem]({% post_url 2021-06-04-theorem %}).
Statements used in proof could be [Axioms]({% post_url 2021-06-04-axioms %}).
