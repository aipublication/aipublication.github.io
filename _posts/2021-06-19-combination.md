Combination of [Sets]({% post_url 2021-06-08-sets %}) of distinct objects is an unordered arrangement of those objects.

Unordered arrangement of $r$ elements of a set is called $r$-combination. 
































































































































































































































































































































































































Number of $r$-combination is denoted as $C(n, r)$ or $\binom n r$ and it is called <b>Binomial Coefficient</b>.

































































































































































































































































































































































































If $n$ and $r$ are non-negative integers such that $0 \le r \le n$ then $$C(n, r) = {n! \over r!(n-r)!}$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































$r$-permutation could be obtained from $r$-combination by ordering elements in each combination.
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$P(n, r) = C(n, r)P(r, r)$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































### Corollary
If $n$ and $r$ are non negative integers such that $r \le n$ then $C(n, r) = C(n, n-r)$
