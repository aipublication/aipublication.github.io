Let number to expand be $n$ and base be $b$.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































First we divide $n$ by $b$ to get *quotient* and *remainder*.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$n = bq_0 + a_0$ such that $0 \le a_0 <b$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































The $a_0$ obtained is rightmost term in expansion.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































Next step is to divide $q_0$ by $b$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$q_0 = bq_1 + a_1$ such that $0 \le a_1 <b$.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































$a_1$ is second last term in expansion.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































We continue this process until quotient is equal to 0.
