To define a [Functions]({% post_url 2021-06-07-functions %}) *recursively* with non-negative integers as its [Domain]({% post_url 2021-06-07-domain %}) we have to do two steps:
**Basis Step**: Specify value of function at 0.
**Recursive Step**: Define a rule to find value of an integer using integers smaller than it.

Recursively Defined Functions are [Well Defined]({% post_url 2021-06-16-well-defined %}).

[Fibonacci Sequence]({% post_url 2021-06-07-fibonacci-sequence %}) has recursive definition.
