Named after French Mathematician <b>Blaise Pascal</b>.

Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n \ge k$. Then
































































































































































































































































































































































































$$\binom {n+1} k = \binom n {k-1} + \binom n k$$

































































































































































































































































































































































































Pascal's Identity with initial conditions $\binom n 0 = \binom n n = 1$ could be used to find <b>Binomial Coefficient</b> using [Recursion]({% post_url 2021-06-17-recursion %}) and this is efficient because addition is used instead of multiplication.

$n$th row in Pascal's Triangle consist of binomial coefficient.
