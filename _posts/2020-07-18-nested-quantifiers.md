They could be thought of as a [[Nested Loop]].
To check if $\forall x \forall y P(x, y)$ is true, first we have to loop through all the values of $x$ and for each value of $x$ we have to loop over values of $y$.

Order of Quantifiers is important unless all of the [[Quantifiers]] are [[Universal Quantifier]] or [[Existential Quantifier]].
