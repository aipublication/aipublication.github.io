We know from [[Formal Definition of Limits]] that *for every real number* $\epsilon >0$ *there exists a* $\delta > 0$ such that 

































































































































































































































































































































































$$|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$$

































































































































































































































































































































































for every $$0 < |x - a| < \delta$$


































































































































































































































































































































































This could be rephrased as
$$\forall \epsilon \exists \delta \forall x (0 < |x - a| < \delta \to |f(x) - L| < \epsilon$$


































































































































































































































































































































































Domain of $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ consists of all positive real numbers and domain of *x* consists of all real numbers.
