**Basis Step**: Height of [Full Binary Tree]({% post_url 2021-06-16-full-binary-tree %}) $T$ containing a single vertex $r$ is $h(T) = 0$

































































































































































































































































































































































**Recursive Step**: If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are [Full Binary Tree]({% post_url 2021-06-16-full-binary-tree %}) then $T = T_1 \cdot T_2$ is also a [Full Binary Tree]({% post_url 2021-06-16-full-binary-tree %}) with height $h(T) = 1 + max(h(T_1), h(T_2))$
