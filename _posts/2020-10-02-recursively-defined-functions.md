To define a [[Functions]] *recursively* with non-negative integers as its [[Domain]] we have to do two steps:
**Basis Step**: Specify value of function at 0.
**Recursive Step**: Define a rule to find value of an integer using integers smaller than it.

Recursively Defined Functions are [[Well Defined]].

[[Fibonacci Sequence]] has recursive definition.
