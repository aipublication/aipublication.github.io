An array takes a fixed chunk of memory and divides it into equal parts which are accessed using indices. 

All the **elements** stored inside an array have same datatype.

These elements are accessed using their respective indices.

    // Array in C++
    int arr[5] = {1, 54, 2131, 231, 3231};
    
    // Accesssing element
    cout<<"First element is:"<<arr[0];

**Lists** are special kinds of arrays that can store elements of multiple datatypes.

    # List in Python, could be used interchangebly as an array
    arr = ["Hello", "World", 2, 3.1, True]
